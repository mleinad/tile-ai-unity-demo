# AI Tile-Based Game â€“ Unity

## Overview

This game was originally developed over the course of a week as part of the **SAP Game Changing Games** project, an international collaboration between universities aimed at tackling rising global challenges through games.  

I worked as the **sole programmer** and part **game designer** alongside 3D artists to develop a **tile-based strategy game** that educates players about **deforestation**.  

Later, I repurposed this project for an **Artificial Intelligence class** along side a colleague by expanding the enemy AI capabilities and introducing **procedural generation**.

## Features

- **Tile-Based Strategy**: Each hexagon acts as a tile on a grid system developed entirely from scratch.  
- **AI Enemy**: Bulldozers traverse the grid using multiple algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - A* Search
- **Procedural Generation**: Levels are dynamically generated to increase replayability.  
- **Graph Traversal Demonstration**: Each tile acts as a node, allowing visualization of AI pathfinding algorithms.

## Procedural Terrain & Sea Generation

The sea and terrain are generated using **Perlin Noise**, producing smooth, natural variations.

## Gameplay

- Players interact with a hexagonal grid with drag and drop base mechanic, strategizing against AI-controlled bulldozers.  
- The game demonstrates the impact of deforestation while showcasing AI techniques in pathfinding.
